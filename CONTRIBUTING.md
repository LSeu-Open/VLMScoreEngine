# Contributing to LLMScoreEngine

First off, thank you for considering contributing to LLMScoreEngine! We appreciate your time and effort to help us improve this project.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into LLMScoreEngine itself.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/VLMScoreEngine/issues). If you've found a bug, please ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues.

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, please [open a new one](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/VLMScoreEngine/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

Provide the following information when reporting a bug:

*   A quick summary and/or background
*   Steps to reproduce
    *   Be specific!
    *   Give sample code if you can.
*   What you expected would happen
*   What actually happens
*   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/LLMScoreEngine/issues/new) with the label "enhancement".

Provide the following information when suggesting an enhancement:

*   A quick summary of the proposed enhancement
*   A detailed description of the enhancement
*   What problems this enhancement will solve
*   Any relevant mockups or examples (if applicable)

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to VLMScoreEngine? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

*   [Good first issues](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/VLMScoreEngine/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
*   [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/LSeu-Open/VLMScoreEngine/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

### Pull Requests

4.  **Set up your development environment** as described in the `README.md`.
5.  **Make your changes** and **add tests** if applicable.
6.  **Ensure your code lints** (if a linter is configured).
7.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Briefly explain the change" 
    # Or "fix: ...", "docs: ...", "style: ...", "refactor: ...", "test: ...", "chore: ..."
    ```
    We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
8.  **Push your branch** to your fork:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-feature-branch-name
    ```
9.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of the `LSeu-Open/VLMScoreEngine` repository.
    *   Fill in the PR template.
    *   Clearly describe the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
    *   Ensure your PR passes all CI checks.
